# 3 Quick Command Line Tips -- More Info

## Tip 1: Set a Friendly Creature Greeting
This command combines cowsay and lolcat

The command I have set for my greeting is:
``` cowsay -f dragon "Greetings, Human!" | lolcat ```

#### cowsay
* Program that displays a ascii art cow saying something. Using option flags you can change the cow to a different creature (I use a dragon).
* Can be installed with ``` brew install cowsay ``` if you use homebrew on mac
* More about this program and what it can do: [wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cowsay)

#### lolcat
* This program is pure rainbow magic. You should always pipe your output to lolcat.
* lolcat can be installed with ``` gem install lolcat ```
* More about this program and what it can do: [github](https://github.com/busyloop/lolcat)

## Tip 2: Taming the 'rm' command
This should probably be used mostly just as "training wheels". This command tip uses an alias to block me from being able to use the rm command.

## Tip 3: Making Mistakes Better (Dealing with Typos)
This tip goes over several programs: sl, gti, thefuck.

#### sl
* This program generates a ascii art steam locomotor.
* Usually I am trying to type in 'ls' to figure out what files are in the current location.
* Can be installed with ``` brew install sl ```

#### gti
* This program generates a ascii art GTI car.
* Usually I am trying to type some git command.
* Can be installed with ``` brew install gti ```
* More info: [brewinstall](http://brewformulas.org/Gti)

#### thefuck
* Magnificent app which corrects your previous console command.
* Lets me curse at the command line and have something useful happen!
* More info: [github](https://github.com/nvbn/thefuck)

## Bonus Tip: Asciiquarium
* You can install it with ``` brew install asciiquarium ```
* I have mine set up with an alias, so I just get to say 'fishies' and I get fish!
* More Info: [site](http://www.robobunny.com/projects/asciiquarium/html/) NOTE: Don't listen to that site on how to install it on mac. You can just homebrew it!
